 The sequence \101 is an octal escape sequence that represents the character with the ASCII code 65 (which is the decimal code for the character 'A'). In C, an octal escape sequence starts with a backslash followed by up to three octal digits, which are interpreted as the binary value of the corresponding ASCII code. In this case, the octal value 101 is equivalent to the decimal value 65, which corresponds to the character 'A' in the ASCII table. Therefore, the printf statement printf("\101\n"); prints the character 'A' followed by a newline character.
